# adabot

This is a stack for the adabot robot. Below are instructions for setting up the adabot workspace; they assume that you have correctly setup your development environment. Visit [the adabot wiki](https://github.com/anthony-jclark/adabot/wiki) for more detailed instructions.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ros_repos/
cd ~/.ros_repos/
hub clone anthony-jclark/adabot.git
hub fork
mkdir -p ~/ros_workspaces/adabot_ws/src/
ln -s ~/.ros_repos/adabot ~/ros_workspaces/adabot_ws/src/
cd ~/ros_workspaces/adabot_ws/
catkin init
catkin config --profile debug -x _debug --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
catkin config --profile release -x _release --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin profile set debug
catkin build
```
